## ✒️ Description
PixelPutt is a 2d puzzle golf game. Players must navigate through the objstacles and different terrain throughout the levels to get in the hole with the least amount of strokes.

## 🕹️ Gameplay
Players begin at a certain place in the level. By draging their mouse when on top of the golf ball, they can choose the orientation and force of their shot. Throughout the levels will be obstacles, static ones like boxes and dynamic like moving spikes. When the player shoots the ball in the hole, he navigates to the title screen to choose his next puzzle!

## 👾 Known Bugs
- Bar bug: If you die to moving spike, force bar will stay
- Passing Between Forms: You can pass between forms composing the map if you shot hard enough when 2 forms collide

## 🎨 Assets
I took inspiration from _super stickman golf game_ for the layout of the game and _dunk shot_ for the force arrow.
